    "Reinforcement Learning is a branch of machine learning (ML) that focuses on the complex and all-encompassing issue of training a system to behave appropriately in a given situation. Only the value of the reward and observations made about the environment are used to drive learning. The generality of this model allows it to be used in a wide range of real-world contexts, from gaming to the improvement of sophisticated industrial procedures.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this perspective, the environment and the agent are two crucial elements of RL. The environment is the Agent's world where it exists and the Agent can engage in interactions with this environment by taking certain actions which cannot change the environment's laws or dynamics.\n",
    "\n",
    "The goal of this work is to develop a Deep Reinforcement Learning environment that simulates a betting strategy. The theory underlying this environment is quite straightforward: placing a bet entails selecting a potential outcome, deciding on a stake size, multiplying it by the winning odds, and then deducting the initial wager and any losses.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here, the agent can choose a discrete action space with the following options for actions: \n",
    "- choose a small, medium, or big wager size. And,\n",
    "- Wagering on the home, draw, or away (1X2 lines), or on the home or away Asian line.\n",
    "\n",
    "It should be noted that the agent can only choose one action from the 15 preceding suggestions.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "In addition, our RL betting environment is a subclass of an OpenAI Gym environment, with an observation space equal to (gameId, home team lineup, away team lineup, betting line(1X2, Asian handicap) and selected odds) and an action space equal to the options available to the agent (the wager size and the chosen outcome). \n",
    "\n",
    "A simple action in the environment consists of getting the current observation and placing a bet. The reward (the investment return), which can be positive or negative, is then calculated and deducting the total amount of the wager.\n",
    "\n",
    "The line that the agent should select will determine the determined amount. In other words, if we bet 1X2 on the line, we can say that the profit can be expressed as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "    - profit = (bet * invested_amount * results * odds) - (bet * invested_amount)\n",
    "             = reward - expense\n",

    "    * bet = the chosen outcome or side (Home win, Draw, Away win)\n",
    "    * invested_amount = bet size\n",
    "    * results = postgame outcome\n",
    "    * odds = 1X2 odds\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "If the agent selects the Asian handicap, the profit will depend on the outcome of the game's goal-difference and the chosen line (Half Integer Line, Integer Line, Quarter Integer Line). The agent can win the full bet or just the half of it, lose the full bet or just the half of it, or return its stake.\n",
    "\n",
    "For instance, the profit could be expressed as follows if the agent had won the wager:\n",
    "\n",
    "    - profit = invested_amount * (odds_ah -1)\n",
    "\n",
    "If the agent wins the half of the bet :\n",
    "\n",
    "    - profit = invested_amount * ((odds_ah - 1) * 0.5))\n",
    "\n",
    "    with : \n",
    "    * invested_amount = bet size\n",
    "    * odds_ah = Asian Handicap odds\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "When there are no more games to play or the user's bank balance is exhausted, an episode will be concluded. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "It should be mentioned that we have decided to divide the betting size values into three categories: small, at 5%; medium, at 20%; and large, at 70% of the entire amount of money we have."
