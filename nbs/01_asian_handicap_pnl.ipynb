    "There are many other types of bets available in this area of sports betting, including the most well-known 1X2. However, the latter presupposes that the investor has a 33% chance of winning and must wager on one of the three possible outcomes: the <b>Home Team</b>, The <b>Away Team</b>, or a <b>Draw</b>.\n",
    "\n",
    "Due to this, a brand-new sort of betting type called Asian handicaps emerged, which denotes that one team effectively leads the other side. It eliminates the possibility of a draw in a game, reducing the number of outcomes to two and raising the likelihood of winning to 50%.\n",
    "\n",
    "We have to note that the favorite team that is at a disadvantage is denoted with a negative sign (-).\n",
    "A plus sign (+) is used to indicate the handicap advantage enjoyed by the underdog squad.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this regard, we have 3 different lines which are available for different games : \n",
    "\n",
    "   - <b> Half Integer Lines :</b> These are the lines that perform the best when it comes to computing payoffs for outcomes with binary options. The outcome of the wager is either a win or a loss.\n",
    "    \n",
    "   - <b> Integer Lines :</b> If the handicap chosen is equal to the score difference, it can result in a bet being returned.\n",
    "    \n",
    "   - <b> Quarter Integer Lines :</b> Divide your wager equally between the two AH lines above. For instance, a handicap of -0.75 is really two handicaps for the price of one, with half of your bet being made at -0.5 and the other half at -1, both of which are given the same odds. In this case, we have a win, a partial win, a partial loss, and a whole loss."
